####### To compile without using a makefile
# To compile an object file from a source file you could execute
# cl /EHsc /nologo /c filename.cpp  # produces filename.obj
# To compile an executable file from an object file, you would execute
# cl /EHsc -O /nologo filename.obj     # produces filename.exe
# To compile an executable file from a source file, you would execute
# cl /EHsc -O /nologo filename.cpp     # produces filename.exe

# each subdirectory contains a Makefile that lists the executable
# files that can be made in that directory.  That list is assigned
# to the make macro named $OBJECTS
# This rule says that the make target named "all" depends on those
# files.  Executing "nmake all" in a subdirectory will cause make
# to build each .exe file listed in that subdirectory's makefile
all: $(OBJECTS) 

# rule that says how to make a .obj object file from a .cpp source file
# for a given source file in a given directory you could compile it
# into an object file by executing "nmake filename.obj"

# $< is a macro defined by make 
#     $< refers to the file being processed (i.e., compiled or linked)

# target to clean up the object files and any core files
# executing "nmake clean" in a subdirectory will remove all
# files named core or any file ending in .obj, or .stackdump
